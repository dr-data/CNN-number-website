        To understand handwriting is not an easy task for a computer. Handwriting is irregular by nature, characters change
        shape even when written by the same person, there are slight variations in the way some characters are written,
        and a change in the length or angle of a line might be all that's needed for one character to turn into another.
        Humans have trouble understanding handwriting very often, even their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help computers read we first simplified the task. Barcodes (which exist since 1951) only require to detect
        an alternating sequence of black and white lines. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) can read text written in
        arbitrary fonts, but relies on their regularity. It can also have trouble with ambiguous characters, so it's sometimes
        helped by special fonts that use distinct character shapes. Palm Pilot devices from the late 90s allowed handwritten
        input but used a special simplified alphabet with characters drawn in a particular size and with a specific set of strokes.

      <p>
        Programming an AI with a precise definition of the shape of numbers so it can tell them apart is not an easy task.
        It has to be broad enough to deal with style variations, and the point at which a 1 becomes a 7, or a 3 becomes an 8,
        is a very gray area. Humans learn the numbers by looking at examples and with time recognition is almost instantaneous and automatic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AI you used at the top of this page uses a type of system called an <strong>artificial neural network</strong> that also learns by
        looking at examples. Neural networks have that name because they are inspired by biological brains and their collection
        of neurons that connect and transmit signals to take input from the sensory organs and generate an appropriate response
        in muscles or other organs. The artificial neural networks are similarly made of thousands of artificial neurons connected
        in a very complex network and they also exchange simple signals that travel between an input and an output.

      <p>
        Since we're limiting the task to recognizing numbers, we have ten outputs: one for each possible character between 0 and 9.
        Each output produces a signal which tells us how much confidence the network has that the input is that particular number.
        At any point the neural network might consider different answers as likely. In the next recognizer you can see bars for each output,
        which grow as the signal becomes stronger. Try drawing a number slowly and see how the bars get bigger and smaller as you proceed.

        Each input is connected to all others and then to the outputs through around 80.000 connections.
        These connections grow stronger or become weaker as the training progresses and substructures
        that are able to detect certain patterns and shapes in the input emerge.

        Our network's training was done with the help of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database" target="_blank">MNIST database</a>,
        a collection of 70.000 images of individual digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the
        American Census Bureau that are shared to help AI researchers. Each image in the MNIST database was pre-labeled
        by a human with the number pictured, so the AI can verify whether its output was correct or not by itself.

      <h2>Further experiments</h2>
      <p>
        Neural networks often understand complex shapes as the combination of simpler visual patterns.
        You can explore the way our fully trained recognizer sees numbers by drawing certain shapes and seeing
        which output bars activate. For instance, notice how drawing a plus sign raises the 4 signal, or how drawing
        an x raises the 8. Other interesting shapes to try are two or three parallel lines (either vertical or horizontal),
        rotated T shapes and half circles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The network can also deal very well with noisy images. Try drawing a number using dots or dashes instead
        of full lines and you'll notice it's still able to identify the numbers quite well.
